### Sign Up & Sign In
Thanks to the Sign Up and Sign in features of the application, each user will have a special account. In order to prevent a student from opening more than one account, students will only be able to register with bilkent e-mail or with their e-mail registered in the bilkent system or with their student ID. Clubs will be able to register to the system with special e-mails to be given to them. Once registered, all users will be ready to log into their own account and have a great experience.

### Organizing Club Events
Thanks to this feature of the application, club accounts will be able to easily create their activities. Each club will create an event by choosing the date and place information from their own page. Students who enter the club's page will be able to easily see this event and indicate whether they will participate or not. In this way, students will not miss the events of the clubs they are interested in. In addition, each participating student will be able to rate that event at the end of the event. The overall score of the club will be determined by taking the average of these scores.
