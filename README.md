### Sign Up & Sign In
Thanks to the Sign Up and Sign in features of the application, each user will have a special account. In order to prevent a student from opening more than one account, students will only be able to register with bilkent e-mail or with their e-mail registered in the bilkent system or with their student ID. Clubs will be able to register to the system with special e-mails to be given to them. Once registered, all users will be ready to log into their own account and have a great experience.

### Organizing Club Events
Thanks to this feature of the application, club accounts will be able to easily create their activities. Each club will create an event by choosing the date and place information from their own page. Students who enter the club's page will be able to easily see this event and indicate whether they will participate or not. In this way, students will not miss the events of the clubs they are interested in. In addition, each participating student will be able to rate that event at the end of the event. The overall score of the club will be determined by taking the average of these scores.

### Event Tracker & Sync Event Calendar
On the event tracker page, students will be able to see the club events they marked as **"Attending"** on a calendar. Thus, they will be able to follow the events they will attend in an orderly manner. In addition to this feature, the calendar on the site will be synchronized one-way with the Google Calendar application, which is used by almost everyone, to make it easier for students to follow the club events they have marked as **"Attending"**.

### Upcoming Events
Thanks to the upcoming events page, students will be able to see the events added to the system by the student clubs that students follow. When they click on any upcoming event that appears on this page, they will be able to read detailed information about the event specified by the student club organizing the event. They will select the events, they want to attend, from the events that they received detailed information of and press the **"Attending"** button. Thus, the system will automatically add this event to the event tracker and trigger synchronization with Google Calendar.
