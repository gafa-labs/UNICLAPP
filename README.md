### Sign Up & Sign In
Thanks to the Sign Up and Sign in features of the application, each user will have a special account. In order to prevent a student from opening more than one account, students will only be able to register with Bilkent e-mail or with their e-mail registered in the Bilkent system or with their student ID. Clubs will be able to register to the system with special e-mails to be given to them. Once registered, all users will be ready to log into their own accounts and have a great experience.

### Organizing Club Events
Thanks to this feature of the application, club accounts will be able to easily create their activities. Each club will create an event by choosing the date and place information from their own page. Students who enter the club's page will be able to easily see this event and indicate whether they will participate or not. In this way, students will not miss the events of the clubs they are interested in. In addition, each participating student will be able to rate that event at the end of the event. The overall score of the club will be determined by taking the average of these scores.

### Event Tracker & Sync Event Calendar
On the event tracker page, students will be able to see the club events they marked as **"Attending"** on a calendar. Thus, they will be able to follow the events they will attend in an orderly manner. In addition to this feature, the calendar on the site will be synchronized one-way with the Google Calendar application, which is used by almost everyone, to make it easier for students to follow the club events they have marked as **"Attending"**.

### Upcoming Events
Thanks to the upcoming events page, students will be able to see the events added to the system by the student clubs that students follow. When they click on any upcoming event that appears on this page, they will be able to read detailed information about the event specified by the student club organizing the event. They will select the events, they want to attend, from the events that they received detailed information of and press the **"Attending"** button. Thus, the system will automatically add this event to the event tracker and trigger synchronization with Google Calendar.

### Profile Page
This is the page that students can view personal information. This personal information includes a profile picture, name-surname, contact mail address, student ID, and student clubs that the student is a member of, respectively. Students can also edit their personal information on this page. In addition, each student has a **"PSI"** score that is calculated by a specific algorithm based on their activities on the events organized by student clubs. **"PSI"** is a personal social activity indicator. Based on the frequency of attending student club events, the role of the student in the club, etc. It is converted to a PAI score using a specific algorithm under development. Students will experience a very valuable social activity experience thanks to PSI. For instance, the student who has a greater PSI score has more say in the decisions taken jointly by the student clubs.  
### Following
Students will be able to examine the all students clubs that are the member of the application. They can check and see the activities, events and the aim of the student clubs by examininig the student clubs pages. The students can follow the student clubs that they want to be a part of and participate in their activities and events. Once a student club is followed, the students can see the upcoming events of the followed club. By this way, students can easily manage their calendars and participate in the activity to be carried out by the student club followed.

### Campus Map
On this page, there is a bird's eye view of the campus plan of Bilkent University. One of the biggest problems experienced by many students, especially newcomers, finding the building and classroom where student club activities will be held. This page aims to be a solution to this problem experienced by many students. Students will be able to choose the building and class number they want to go to from the list. Then, the selected location will be marked on the map. Moreover, the coordinate of the location is transferred to the map application preferred by the student. Thus, students will be able to reach their desired location quickly and easily. All these operations can also be done automatically by clicking on the location information on the page with **Upcoming Events**.
